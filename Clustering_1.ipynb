    "# Question 1: What are the different types of clustering algorithms, and how do they differ in terms of their approach and underlying assumptions?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Clustering algorithms can be categorized into:\n",
    "1. **Partition-based clustering** (e.g., K-Means) - Divides data into K clusters based on similarity.\n",
    "2. **Hierarchical clustering** (e.g., Agglomerative, Divisive) - Creates a tree-like cluster hierarchy.\n",
    "3. **Density-based clustering** (e.g., DBSCAN) - Identifies dense clusters, useful for irregular shapes.\n",
    "4. **Model-based clustering** (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models) - Assumes data follows a probability distribution.\n",
    "5. **Grid-based clustering** (e.g., STING) - Divides data space into a grid and clusters based on density.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: What is K-means clustering, and how does it work?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "K-Means is a partition-based clustering algorithm that:\n",
    "1. Selects K initial centroids.\n",
    "2. Assigns each data point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "3. Recomputes centroids as the mean of assigned points.\n",
    "4. Iterates steps 2 and 3 until convergence.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 3: What are some advantages and limitations of K-means clustering compared to other clustering techniques?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "- Simple and efficient for large datasets.\n",
    "- Works well with well-separated clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "- Assumes spherical clusters.\n",
    "- Sensitive to outliers and initial centroid selection.\n",
    "- Requires specifying K beforehand.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4: How do you determine the optimal number of clusters in K-means clustering, and what are some common methods for doing so?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Common methods include:\n",
    "- **Elbow Method**: Analyzes within-cluster sum of squares.\n",
    "- **Silhouette Score**: Measures how well data points fit their assigned clusters.\n",
    "- **Gap Statistic**: Compares clustering performance with random distributions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 5: What are some applications of K-means clustering in real-world scenarios, and how has it been used to solve specific problems?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Applications:\n",
    "- Customer segmentation in marketing.\n",
    "- Image compression.\n",
    "- Anomaly detection in cybersecurity.\n",
    "- Document categorization.\n",
    "- Medical diagnosis (e.g., grouping patients by symptoms).\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 6: How do you interpret the output of a K-means clustering algorithm, and what insights can you derive from the resulting clusters?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Each cluster represents a distinct group based on similarity.\n",
    "- Centroids indicate the \"average\" data point of each cluster.\n",
    "- Cluster sizes help identify dominant patterns in data.\n",
    "- Outliers may indicate unique or mislabeled data.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 7: What are some common challenges in implementing K-means clustering, and how can you address them?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Challenges and solutions:\n",
    "- **Choosing K**: Use Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.\n",
    "- **Handling outliers**: Remove or use robust clustering methods.\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Use Mini-Batch K-Means for large datasets.\n",
    "- **Non-spherical clusters**: Use DBSCAN or hierarchical clustering instead.\n",
