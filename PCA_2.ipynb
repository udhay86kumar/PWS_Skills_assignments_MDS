    "# Question 1: What are Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors? How are they related to the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Eigenvalues are scalars that indicate how much an eigenvector is stretched or compressed during a linear transformation.\n",
    "Eigenvectors are special vectors that do not change their direction when a linear transformation is applied.\n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition involves decomposing a matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "For a matrix A, if v is an eigenvector and \\lambda is an eigenvalue:\n",
    "A v = \\lambda v\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 2: What is eigen decomposition and what is its significance in linear algebra?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Eigen-Decomposition (or spectral decomposition) is the process of factorizing a matrix into eigenvalues and eigenvectors.\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "- Used in Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "- Helps in solving differential equations\n",
    "- Used in stability analysis\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",

    "# Question 3: What are the conditions that must be satisfied for a square matrix to be diagonalizable using the Eigen-Decomposition approach? Provide a brief proof to support your answer.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "A matrix A is diagonalizable if it has n linearly independent eigenvectors.\n",
    "Condition: The matrix must have n distinct eigenvalues or be diagonalizable by finding a complete set of eigenvectors.\n",
    "Proof:\n",
    "If A can be written as A = P D P^{-1}, where D is a diagonal matrix, then A is diagonalizable.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 4: What is the significance of the spectral theorem in the context of the Eigen-Decomposition approach? How is it related to the diagonalizability of a matrix? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "The spectral theorem states that a symmetric matrix can be diagonalized using an orthogonal matrix.\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "- Used in PCA and SVD\n",
    "- Helps in understanding quadratic forms\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "A symmetric matrix has real eigenvalues and an orthonormal set of eigenvectors.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 5: How do you find the eigenvalues of a matrix and what do they represent?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Eigenvalues are found by solving det(A - \\lambda I) = 0.\n",
    "They represent scaling factors of eigenvectors in a linear transformation.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 6: What are eigenvectors and how are they related to eigenvalues?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Eigenvectors are nonzero vectors that remain in the same direction after a linear transformation.\n",
    "They satisfy A v = \\lambda v, where \\lambda is an eigenvalue.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 7: Can you explain the geometric interpretation of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Eigenvectors represent directions in which a transformation scales the space without changing direction.\n",
    "Eigenvalues indicate the amount of stretching or compression in those directions.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 8: What are some real-world applications of eigen decomposition?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)\n",
    "- Image compression\n",
    "- Vibration analysis in engineering\n",
    "- Quantum mechanics\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 9: Can a matrix have more than one set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues?\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "Yes, but the eigenvalues are unique. Eigenvectors can form different bases if the matrix has repeated eigenvalues.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Question 10: In what ways is the Eigen-Decomposition approach useful in data analysis and machine learning? Discuss at least three specific applications or techniques that rely on Eigen-Decomposition.\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "1. PCA: Reduces dimensionality by projecting data onto principal components.\n",
    "2. Spectral Clustering: Uses eigenvalues of similarity matrices for clustering.\n",
    "3. Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA): Uses eigen decomposition in NLP for document similarity.\n",
