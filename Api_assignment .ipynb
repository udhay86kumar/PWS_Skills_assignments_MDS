    "Shortcomings of SOAP:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: SOAP APIs can be more complex to implement and use due to the XML-based message format and rigid specifications.\n",
    "Performance: The XML payload in SOAP can be larger compared to RESTful JSON payloads, leading to higher bandwidth consumption and slower performance.\n",
    "Standardization: Different SOAP implementations can lead to interoperability issues between different systems.\n",
    "Scalability: SOAP APIs might not be as scalable as RESTful APIs for large-scale applications due to the overhead introduced by XML parsing."
